# Historic Documents

A curated collection of historically significant documents that shaped the development of computers, programming, and the internet. This repository serves as my personal archive of foundational papers, RFCs, engineering notes, and other influential texts that document the evolution of computing technology.

## Purpose

This repository preserves important technical documents that:
- Introduced groundbreaking concepts or technologies
- Shaped industry standards and practices  
- Provide historical context for modern computing
- Demonstrate the evolution of technical thinking over time

## Organization

Documents are organized in the `documents/` directory with descriptive filenames. Each document includes both historical context and the original text when possible.

## Featured Documents

- **[On Holy Wars and A Plea for Peace](documents/On_Holy_Wars_and_A_Plea_for_Peace.md)** - Danny Cohen's seminal 1980 paper on endianness that coined the terms "Big-Endian" and "Little-Endian"
- **[The Therac-25 Investigation](documents/Therac-25_Investigation.md)** - Leveson & Turner's landmark 1993 investigation into software safety failures that led to radiation overdoses and deaths
- **[On Computable Numbers](documents/Turing_On_Computable_Numbers.md)** - Alan Turing's foundational 1936 paper that introduced Turing machines and established the theoretical basis for computer science
- **[A Mathematical Theory of Communication](documents/Shannon_Mathematical_Theory_Communication.md)** - Claude Shannon's groundbreaking 1948 work that established information theory and provided the mathematical foundation for the digital age
- **[Go To Statement Considered Harmful](documents/Dijkstra_Go_To_Statement_Considered_Harmful.md)** - Edsger Dijkstra's influential 1968 letter that sparked the structured programming movement and changed how we write code
- **[RFC 791: Internet Protocol](documents/RFC_791_Internet_Protocol.md)** - Jon Postel's 1981 specification that defined IPv4 and provided the addressing foundation for the modern internet
- **[RFC 822: Internet Text Messages](documents/RFC_822_Internet_Text_Messages.md)** - David Crocker's 1982 specification that established the email message format and addressing system still used today
- **[RFC 1: Host Software](documents/RFC_1_Host_Software.md)** - Steve Crocker's historic 1969 document that launched the RFC series and established the collaborative process that built the internet
