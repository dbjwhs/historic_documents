## Historical Context

Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" (TAOCP) stands as one of the most influential and comprehensive works in computer science. Originally conceived as a single book on compiler design in the late 1950s, it evolved into a multi-volume exploration of fundamental algorithms and their analysis. The work has shaped how computer scientists think about algorithms, analysis of algorithms, and the mathematical foundations of programming.

Bill Gates famously said: *"If you think you're a really good programmer... read [Knuth's] Art of Computer Programming... You should definitely send me a resume if you can read the whole thing."*
